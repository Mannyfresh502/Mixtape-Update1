            <h3>Blow The Whistle</h3>
            <p>I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made a thousand songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
Two singers and ten comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word? Bitch
Why they gotta say it like $hort? Bitch
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle</p>

One, one, one for the money, yes

One, one, one for the money yes, uhh, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin' ta find that hookup

Now, everyday we look up at the ceilin'
Watchin' ceilin' fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin'
Off instrumental, had my pencil, and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur

Writin' rhymes tryin' ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin' the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin' the crowd move but we not makin' no G's
And that's a nono

Yeah, uhh, check it, ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin' the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin'
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin', they payin'

We stay in layin' vocals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea, dem niggaz they makin' big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
Around this bitch

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doz
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too

            <p>Rihanna
Feel it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the the thrill (I'm Ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (C'mon)
Can't be scaring nickels down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gon' run this town tonight
Is who gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town

Jay-Z
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get y'all fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds, riding with they Dillingers
I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryna get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talking five comma six zeroes dot zero ?
Back to running circles 'round n*****, now we squared up
Hold up

Rihanna
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who gon' run this town tonight

Go, go, go, go, go
Listen (go, go, let's go)
I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars when the star got no ceiling
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out)
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out), yeah
Yeah, she got a little butt, so what? (Ayy)
Big bag, she can show enough
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out)
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out), yeah
My regards to the broads that thought I was done
Pick a side, pick a side and die on the joint
I've been lettin' things slide, they tryin' too hard
'Cause I ain't left the city once, still travel abroad
Nigga, I'm back on my boss shit
The stick in that Honda Civic, we in the car service
I really just mind my business and pray that God sort 'em
Can't really be long-winded, you talkin' short money
Today, we not cost cuttin', can you stick it out?
Told me she was quarantined, them brand-new titties out
And it might be a couple weeks to make them bitches bounce
So I mean it when I be like, "What's the turn around?"
No really, turn around
Okay, I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me (gon' lie?)
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars when the star got no ceiling
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out)
Stick it out (stick it out), poke it out (poke it out), yeah
Yeah, she got a little butt, so what? (Ayy)

            <h3>God Did</h3>
            <p>It breaks my heart
They ain't believe in us
We the Best Music
They played themselves
While you hatin' and being jealous
You could be over here embracin' that love
More love, more blessings, more life
GOD DID
You either win with us, or you watch us win
DJ Khaled
They wanted us down, ooh-whoa
But look at us now, oh
They counted us out (time to say a prayer)
They didn't think that we would make it, oh
They didn't believe in us (may we bow our heads)
Oh, but I know God did, God did (oh, yes, He did)
Oh, God did (Khaled)
Oh, yes, God did (Khaled)
Oh, God did (God is great)
But I know God did
Nosedive, they just prayin' that I crash (huh)
Those guys, they don't wanna see you last
They'll jack up three million dollars up on your tax
A tub full of money, I still can't relax
Tires spinnin'
Lord forgive me, I'm a sinner, conquer, divide niggas
Wrong side of the petition, only divine winnin'
Better listen when I tell you how I put time in it
Please, forgive me, God did
So leave me in the dark, swimmin' with the sharks
Dope boy, big calm, still the biggest boss
Got a kilo on a plate, send 'em on a freight
Or I can go and buy a bank, I know my money's safe (Maybach Music)
They counted us out
They didn't think that we would make it, oh
They didn't believe in us
Oh, but I know God did, God did (oh, yes, He did)
Oh, God did (oh)
Oh, yes, God did (oh)
Oh, God did (Mula)
But I know God did (uh)</p>

            <p>Dress it up and make it real for me
Whatever that fucking means
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 Miles on the dash
Gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapid
We the ones that kept it cool
With all these niggas 'til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
We ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average
Dirty muddy in a cup
45 by my gut
My young nigga in a cut
Taking you out for some Jordans
Let's count this money, no rushin'
I'm on a one way, flushin'
Loud pack smelling musty
These fuckin' police can't touch me
These police, police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me
Apply the pressure with the VVS
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Ch-skrt
Lift it up and gone and off-set it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry

Hello? What the deal? Big

[Hook]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
Countin' money while they ring, ring, ringin'
Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load

Trap jumpin' I'm ring, ring, ringin'

[Verse 1]
Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket park
Parking lot might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

She was one of them bitches you hit in the morning, like " Come to the door!"
Resting her eyes while she drive, she coming str8 to me
She put that rachet pussy, head on me
Nigga I'm going str8 to sleep

Hold up, hold up lil bitch you tripping out

Had to cut you off, like some scissors a do
Ain got lie, yo like action was clutch but you was doin 2 much!
Telling yo friends what we got going on, bitch keep that onna hush

I got a thang for bitches
Ion really hang with bitches

            <p>Living Life and chasing dreams searching for the better things
              Open up my eyes and see that all I need I see in Me

            Mommas son daddys thug barely felt my mothers love
          emotions they push and shove a troubled child still holds a grudge
        Never budge stand strong head chest out
        Things my poppa told me and I still tookthat back route
        Black out sweaty nights trying to get my life right
        Cause what Im seeing so deceiving in love with the city lights
        Bright lights camera action but I write my own script
        Southside Newburg Lincoln Park I represent
        Heaven sent God's Body but you can say I'm God's son
        Chedar sinning Lord forgive us chasing stacks of Benjamin
        Where Im from we never switch I was raised to never fold
        On the yellow brick road looking for an exit door(doe)
